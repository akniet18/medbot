## Goals:
+ The main goal of this project is to make life of our customers easier, by providing the system which will consult them before they will visit the doctor. It will help our clietns to save their time and maybe some money. Nowadays, visiting doctor sometimes takes too long time, and usually after first visit client will take a direction to pass some analysis, and visits him secondary, and of course first and secondary visits will cost some money. Our system(online bot) will be able to consult clients in the first step of visit, I mean bot will ask them some questions, like, what kind of symptoms do they have, and by processing this information will give them direction to needed analysis. And after will show the list of corresponding doctor and shows the work schedule of this doctor, and his available time to visit so that you can make an appointment at the available time.

# Week 4:

## Risks:
+ Our recommendation system of bot, which is a key differentiator of your project, may be difficult to set up correctly. We must be pretty accurate in process of collecting information, and by processing of this information, make correct suggetions for clients.
+ The process of seeking and processing of information can take more time, than we think.
+ Process of creating bot must not be so hard and must not take more time than we suppose, but, process of logic constructions with collected information can be harder than we think, and also can take more time.
+ Also human risk, someone can feel himself sick, and couldn't work for some days, in that case we also can lose time.
